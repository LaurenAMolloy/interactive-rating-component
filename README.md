## My process
First, I watched a few tutorials on bootstrap and read the documentation as I wanted to experiment with this to create a responsive layout.

Then I started with the html adding the bootstrap container, row and columns. Then I added the styles, padding and colors to the elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about creating responsive layouts using the bootstrap grid system. I would like to explore this more in future projects. I was able to practice some concepts in JavaScript such as manipulating the DOM, using querySelector, Foreach loops and eventListener.


### Continued development

I want to continue mastering the techniques I haved used in this project. It took me a while to build so I would liek to improve my use of time.
